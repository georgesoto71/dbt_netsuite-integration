# dbt_netsuite v0.6.1

## Bug Fixes 🐞
- Properly applies new passthrough column logic to allow for the use of `alias` and `transform_sql` (see v0.6.0 below). ([#43](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite/issues/43))

# dbt_netsuite v0.6.0
🎉 [Netsuite2](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/article_163465025391.html) Compatibility 🎉
PR [#41](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_netsuite/pull/41) includes the following update to the dbt_netsuite package:
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- The declaration of passthrough variables within your root `dbt_project.yml` has changed. To allow for more flexibility and better tracking of passthrough columns, you will now want to define passthrough columns in the following format:
> This applies to all passthrough columns within the `dbt_netsuite` package and not just the `customers_pass_through_columns` example.
```yml
vars:
  customers_pass_through_columns:
    - name: "my_field_to_include" # Required: Name of the field within the source.
      alias: "field_alias" # Optional: If you wish to alias the field within the staging model.
      transform_sql: "cast(field_alias as string)" # Optional: If you wish to define the datatype or apply a light transformation.
```
## Features 🎉
- Addition of the `netsuite_data_model` variable. This variable may either be `netsuite` (the original Netsuite.com connector endpoint) or `netsuite2` (the new Netsuite2 connector endpoint).
  - The variable is set to `netsuite` by default. If you wish to run the data models for the Netsuite2 connector, you may simply change the variable within your root dbt_project.yml to `netsuite2`.
- Postgres compatibility!
- Added identifier variables to each Netsuite.com and Netsuite2 source to enable dynamic source-table adjustments.
- Applied schema level tests to each Netsuite2 end model to ensure data validation.
- README updates for easier navigation and package use.
# dbt_netsuite v0.5.0
🎉 dbt v1.0.0 Compatibility 🎉
## 🚨 Breaking Changes 🚨
- Adjusts the `require-dbt-version` to now be within the range [">=1.0.0", "<2.0.0"]. Additionally, the package has been updated for dbt v1.0.0 compatibility. If you are using a dbt version <1.0.0, you will need to upgrade in order to leverage the latest version of the package.
  - For help upgrading your package, I recommend reviewing this GitHub repo's Release Notes on what changes have been implemented since your last upgrade.
  - For help upgrading your dbt project to dbt v1.0.0, I recommend reviewing dbt-labs [upgrading to 1.0.0 docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/migration-guide/upgrading-to-1-0-0) for more details on what changes must be made.
- Upgrades the package dependency to refer to the latest `dbt_netsuite_source`. Additionally, the latest `dbt_netsuite_source` package has a dependency on the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils`. Further, the latest `dbt_fivetran_utils` package also has a dependency on `dbt_utils` [">=0.8.0", "<0.9.0"].
  - Please note, if you are installing a version of `dbt_utils` in your `packages.yml` that is not in the range above then you will encounter a package dependency error.
